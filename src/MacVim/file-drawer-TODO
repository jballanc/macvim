* After renaming a file/dir we should re-open buffers that reference that file.
* How should we handle creating a new file?
* In actions get the selected items instead of using the menu item tag
* Don't include MacVim in the list of apps to open a file with.
* Opening files in split views does so in a new tab instead of in the current.
* Should we disable the cwd menu item if that dir is already the wd?
* Add support for multiple file selection in the contextual menu.
* There's some duplication with regards to selecting a new/renamed item
* highlight the file that's open in the current window
* Instead of never allowing the view to become the first responder, we could also only allow it to become first responder when clicked a second time. This allows you to still browse through the files with arrows/enter. (This is what TextMate does.)

* Files that should always be ignored:
  - .DS_Store

* fix that annoying bug with the tab bar controller, I think it's caused when moving the first tab before itself or something.
