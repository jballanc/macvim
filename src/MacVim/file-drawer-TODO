* Use h/j/k/l to navigate and enter to open
* Eliminate use of evaluateVimExpression: and replace with addVimInput:, create a function which takes the path and deletes in one go.
* Deleting a file in a folder with spaces in it doesn't close the buffer, because it can't find it by name.
* Creating a new file doesn't honor the preferences regarding opening a new tab or not.
* Should we check if the option key is pressed down while opening the contextual menu and creating a new file which would make it open a new tab/current tab?
* Always highlight the file in the browser that's open in the current window, unless the enclosed folder is closed. (In which case it should only be openend when explicitely requested by the user.)
* In actions get the selected items instead of using the menu item tag
* Don't include MacVim in the list of apps to open a file with.
* Opening files in split views does so in a new tab instead of in the current.
* Should we disable the cwd menu item if that dir is already the wd?
* Add support for multiple file selection in the contextual menu.
* There's some duplication with regards to selecting a new/renamed item
* Instead of never allowing the view to become the first responder, we could also only allow it to become first responder when clicked a second time. This allows you to still browse through the files with arrows/enter. (This is what TextMate does.)

* Files that should always be ignored:
  - .DS_Store

* fix that annoying bug with the tab bar controller, I think it's caused when moving the first tab before itself or something.
