* removing a directory that contains several levels deep nested directories causes a segfault.
* currently when a change occurs in a directory, we load all the children while looking for the directory even though the item might not have been opened in the browser. So stop traversing once a node is found that has not loaded its children yet.
* add toggle menu item 'hide/show hidden files'
* when an item is reloaded, the view seems to loose its width
